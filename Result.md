## Discussion of the results
At the beginning, I expected that the water area of Cuu Long Delta rise upward during the period shown due to the climate change and the rise of the sea level. 

From the result, it seem like there is no such upward trend. The reason might come form many different aspects:
+ The fluctuation of average temperature lead to the water evaporation.
+ The improvement of the dam systems.
+ The influence of storms during wet season.
